# Bootlegger

Bootlegger is an arcade game in which we will take the role of ... ourselves, and we will be the victim of a ransomware, a virus installed in the operating system of our computer that will force us to play a series of minigames to end it, from games like the mythical Pong to Top-Down Shooters.
